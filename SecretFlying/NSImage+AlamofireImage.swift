     The `completion` closure is called after the image download and filtering are complete.
     - parameter URL:                        The URL used for the image request.
     - parameter placeholderImage:           The image to be set initially until the image request finished. If
     `nil`, the image view will not change its image until the image
     request finishes. Defaults to `nil`.
     - parameter filter:                     The image filter applied to the image after the image request is
     finished. Defaults to `nil`.
     - parameter progress:                   The closure to be executed periodically during the lifecycle of the
     request. Defaults to `nil`.
     - parameter progressQueue:              The dispatch queue to call the progress closure on. Defaults to the
     main queue.
     - parameter completion:                 A closure to be executed when the image request finishes. The closure
     has no return value and takes three arguments: the original request,
     the response from the server and the result containing either the
     image or the error that occurred. If the image was returned from the
     image cache, the response will be `nil`. Defaults to `nil`.
